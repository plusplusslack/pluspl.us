# PlusPl.us Server

PlusPl.us is a resurrection of the former [plusplus.chat](http://plusplus.chat). It was implemented in Python and
is (somewhat) based on the [Javascript version](https://github.com/tdmalone/working-plusplus/) by @tdmalone, but has
been expanded to work as a fully hosted Slack app for multiple teams like the original plusplus.chat.

If you didn't use plusplus.chat before it went offline, it was an app that let you reward members of your Slack team
with imaginary points. All you had to do was type something like `@jake++` to reward someone a point, or `@jake--`
to take away a point. A few additional features have been built in (see below), and more features are planned.


### Features

- `@jake++`: give a point to a user or a thing
- `@jake--`: take a point away from a user or a thing
- `@jake==`: get the current number of points a user or thing has
- `@pluspl.us leaderboard`: get (up to) 10 of the top users and things
- `@pluspl.us loserboard`: get (up to) 10 of the bottom users and things
- `@pluspl.us reset`: permanently removes all points from a Slack team
- `@pluspl.us help`: get a list of the available commands from within Slack
